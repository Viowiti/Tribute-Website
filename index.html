				Chadwick Boseman was a role model to millions of people of color. He embodied everything we stand for. A passionate actor who brought some iconic characters to the big screen, he will be sorely missed. Below we take a sneak peak at three of his best works.

				<h3>1. Black Panther.</h3>
				<img src="https://experienceindyoregon.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Copy-of-Untitled-7.png" alt="Black Panther movie poster" class="movie-poster">
				<p class="p-tags">Chadwick playing the role of T'chala, the crown prince of a mythical nation, Wakanda. When his father suddenly dies, he is charged with succeeding him as 'Black Panther', warrior-king and protector of Wakanda. The film covers various themes including responsibility, colonialism, family and many others. You come to terms with the kind of technology that is so advanced, coupled with strong characters like W'Kabi, Michael B. Jordan's Eric Killmonger and the Dora Milaje, best female fighters to grace the screens, in my opinion.</p>

				<h3>2. Rainey's Black Bottom</h3>
				<img src="https://i2.wp.com/thecurvyfilmcritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MRBB_Horizontal_Main_RGB_Theatrical_EN-US.jpg?resize=1140%2C463&ssl=1" class="movie-poster">
				<p class="p-tags">This film was released after Chadwick had passed on. For his performance, he earned an Acaemy Award nomination for best actor in a leading role. He plays Levee Green, a member of Ma Raineys band, where he plays the trumpet. A young man with a traumatic past, and with dreams of one day having his own band. While hopeful, we realize that he is a broken young man due to the trauma from his childhood. This film brought a side of Chad's depth as an actor that I had never seen before.</p>

				<h3>3. The Avengers, Infinity War</h3>
				<img src="https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Avengers-Infinity-War-feature.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=960&h=500&dpr=1.5" class="movie-poster">
				<p class="p-tags">Chad reprises the role of Tchala, King of Wakanda in this Marvel Studios blockbuster. The Avengers, earth's mightiest heroes are charged with stopping the Mad Titan Thanos from executing his plan to wipe out half of the population in the universe. An epic battle in Wakanda if for me the biggest highlight of this movie. Get to experience Wakanda in all its might go against Thanos, the Dark Order and his Outriders.</p>
